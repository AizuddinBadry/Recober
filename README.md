# Recober - Membership Management System

##INTRODUCTION
This is new repo of Recober that represent pure ReactJS programming language and environment that port out from React on Rails (old Recober).

##STATUS OF PROJECT
Project still in development status.

##TECH USED
~ ReactJS
~ Webpack
~ Browserify
~ ES6

##DEVELOPMENT WORKS STATUS
Major development are being redesign and port out from React on Rails framework > Pure ReactJS.

###Reason
-Every pure ReactJS component from NPM need to convert to Rails Assets pipeline (GEM). The assets available are not updated and not maintaned to meet latest ES. All the assets can be found at https://rails-assets.org which is really limited.

-Most of the functionalities finished almost (70% ~ 80%) in React on Rails. Have very difficulties in configuration every function. p/s every function have different configuration in React on Rails. Browserify, ES5 converter, etc..

-Foundation Zurb working 60% on React on Rails and 80% on pure ReactJS.

-Since we are focusing to separate WebApp and API then there's no need to have 'Rails' in React.
